I was struggling to get the door to animate and function properly, the toggle switches just were not working.

I had an idea last night on a way to make it work, so today I scrapped all the switch and door assets and started
from scratch, and now we have a versatile toggle open/closed structure that can be repurposed for use in future game
mechanics.
